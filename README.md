# Introduction

This is a relatively application and set of libraries that can be used to show
Collatz conjecture, which is defined via the following rules:

1. Take any arbitrary whole number
2. If that number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. If that number is even, divide by two.

If you repeat steps 2 and 3 enough times, you will always end up with a end loop
of `4, 2, 1`.  As 1 is odd when you perform the operation (3x + 1) it is an
endless loop.

This application and set of libraries are meant to be a fun way to help 
demonstrate a simple sounding math problems as well provide some examples of
working with streaming data.

You are free to download the source and build for any of your own devices, or to
play around with the [online web based application](https://peiffer-innovations.github.io/three_x_plus_1/web/).

For more information on the 3x + 1 conjecture, see this really awesome video by
Veritasium hosted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg).
